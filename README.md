# AutoHack 2025 Dataset

A high-fidelity vehicular cybersecurity dataset collected from a modern production vehicle under real-world driving conditions.

The dataset provides synchronized multi-CAN bus logs and includes advanced attack scenarios such as UDS-based diagnostics manipulation and timing-aware Replay attacks.

Attack impacts were physically verified to ensure reliable ground-truth labeling, including safety-related vehicle responses observed during controlled injections.

Benchmark evaluations indicate that this dataset presents a significant challenge to existing intrusion detection systems and supports reproducible cybersecurity research in automotive environments.
